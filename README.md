# YouTube-Swapper
Experience YouTube uncensored.

Replace whatever YouTube video you're watching with what the creator actually wants you to watch.

If you're a creator, include a line in your YouTube video's description like so:
YouTube Swapper: http://www.example.com/video/link

Only supports links to BitChute and YouTube.

Note: This is something I thought up and programmed in a few days, and as of Dec. 28th 2019 it is brand new, simplistic, and doesn't have many features. It's free an open source. I'm open to feature requests and bug reports.
